Analysis

1.) The correlation coefficient for mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin regimen is 0.8419. This is a strong correlation, suggesting that mouse weight is a factor for the effectiveness of the Capomulin treatment for mice. 

2.) There is one possible outlier for the Infubinol treatment set. One of the mice treated with a final total volume of 36.32 mm3 clearly places outside the bounds of the whiskers of the Infubinol treatment boxplot.

3.) The Ramicane regimen is one of the relative outperformers for effective treatments as it has the lowest mean tumor volume at 40.2167 mm3 and the lowest median tumor volume at 40.6732 mm3 out of all ten drugs. Ramicane also has the lowest standard deviation and standard error.
